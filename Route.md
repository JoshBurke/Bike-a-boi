# Route Map

## Pre-planning
[This link](https://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/interactive-network-map/?routecondition=true&amtrak=true) is a really cool interactive map which we can use to plan bike paths along amtrak routes. I think we should take this general route:
* Amtrak from Chicago to Los Angeles
* Take the Bike Route 66 to Angeles National Forest, camp one night (we'd be staying along bike route 66 for pretty much the whole time)
* Bike through Victorville, through Barstow, to Rodman Mountains Wilderness Area? camp one night?
* Bike (see the Pisgah lava tubes) to Mojave National Preserve (we'd have to get off the route a little bit) camp one night
* Bike
